### GreenComputerVision
Looking into ACC, AUC, and Cost variations between 6 PyTorch models using the AzureML stack and a NVIDIA T4 GPU. Using DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, ResNet18, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuned to the MedMNIST pediatric pneumonia dataset, performance measurements are made during inference and compared.

### Pm25_HumanHealth
Combining two datasets from University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and US Center for Disease Control which both use county level observations, to inspect any relationship between airborne PM2.5 pollution concentration and human mortality.  

### Fetal_Health
Find top features for medical professionals to use in a clinical setting to identify fetal health by creating a multiclass model trained on fetal cardiotocogram results.

### Falling_Sky
Query the NASA API to gather information available about Near Earth Objects (NEO) and then calculate details about a potential impact with Earth. Organize the details and supplementary information into a data package for a UI display.

### RecreationFinder
Serving as the foundation for an app. With a user supplied address (ex: "257 E Center Street Moab UT") find the nearest national park.  
* Collect national park information by querying the NPS API
* Find the nearest park via the Haversine formula
* Prepare a data package for a UI
* Create a mock UI output of script
