# Recreation Finder App

## Goal
Create a Proof of Concept for an app which takes in a user supplied address (ex: "257 E Center Street Moab UT") and finds the nearest national park. 
This should not just be the name of a park but also contain information about the park selected to provide a better user experience. 

<br>

## Methods
* Collect national park information by querying the NPS API
* Find the nearest park via the Haversine formula
* Prepare a data package for a UI
* Create a mock UI output of script

<br>
